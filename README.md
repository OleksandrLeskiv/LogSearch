Repository contains two projects, web and console applications. 
To work with console application, you should pass two arguments to main method, path to folder files and wild card.
Web application is much easier to use, after load, you are on search page where you can enter your wildcard and program will search through logs.

Warning! Programs do not contain any log files, you should add yours.
